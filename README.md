# UAV-object-recognition-yolov8
UAV object recognition yolov8
Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing object recognition and tracking using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) and the OpenCV library. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system, and OpenCV provides a versatile set of tools for computer vision tasks.

Features
Object Detection: YOLOv8 is employed to detect objects in images and video streams.
Real-time Tracking: OpenCV is used for tracking the detected objects in real-time.
Efficient Processing: The project emphasizes efficiency in both object detection and tracking for real-time applications.
Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
OpenCV library
YOLOv8 weights and configuration files
Pre-trained YOLOv8 model (downloadable from the official YOLO website)
